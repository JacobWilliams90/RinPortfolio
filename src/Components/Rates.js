          We offer 3 different packages. Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Not to
          mention we do take requests for Custom poses. Check out each package
          below.

          Once your rate has been calculated with any add-ons, at least 50% of
          the order total will need to be collected before the shoot can begin.
          You can prepay in full as well if you wish to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default, we will post all pictures taken in our personal portfolios
          to show examples of our work to other potential clients. If you wish
          for a shoot to remain private, please let us know beforehand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adjustments are to be expected with pre-made poses, however, depending
          on how much is needed there may be additional charges that we will
          discuss with you before completing a pose so that you may either
          choose a new one or continue. This will be on a case by case basis, up
          to our custom pose pricing.

          Additional info regarding photo shoot rules will be available in
          Discord.
